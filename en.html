				<h3>Get to know us</h3>
				<p>
					Maisha Roots is an NGO that combines the efforts of two entities, a Spanish one (Progress Spain) and a Tanzanian one (FYWCO, Focus for Youth, Woman and Children Organization), with the common goal of fostering development in Tanzania.
				</p>
				<p>
					Its origins are found in the local decision of establishing a prosperous community to achieve the development of the community where we work. 
				</p>

			<h3>Mission, vision and action areas</h3>
			<div class="text-block justify-text">
				<p><img src="./img/collage.png" alt="">
					Maisha roots believes in development cooperation as a tool of accompaniment and local empowerment, always through a participative approach. Thus, our mission focuses on the improvement of the life quality of its beneficiaries in the areas of livelihood and education. We also consider that, in order to achieve it, it is also necessary to promote other areas.  
				</p> 
				<p>
					The name Maisha Roots comes from the Swahili word <strong>‘maisha’</strong>, which means life, and the English word <strong>‘roots’</strong>, forming the expression ‘life roots’. It represents the two main action pillars of the organization: education and livelihood. 
				</p>
				<p>
					We have chosen livelihood and education to be our core action areas because we believe the development of people and communities is closely linked to both of them. We understand <strong>‘livelihood’</strong>as every activity developing the productive aspect of a person, through which the person obtains experience and remuneration. We understand <strong>‘education’</strong> as every training or formation dedicated to developing the intellectual, moral, and affective capacity of a person as well as the civil right to receive basic and free education.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p class="border-left ">
					Livelihood and education are two tools that contribute to the <strong>autonomy, independence, and empowerment</strong> of people. Moreover, education and livelihood strengthen values, dynamics, and initiatives that answers other population demands and wishes. Therefore, Maisha Roots focuses on fostering the capacity and resources for the <strong>construction of common well-being, evolution, and development.</strong>

						In 2019, an eco-friendly orchard for communitarian use as well as for the education of the children attending school was built in the Chagua Maisha space. At the end of this year, we gave the total Chagua Maisha management to the local counterpart. We decided to start a new project in the community.

				<div class="timeline-event">
					<div class="timeline-event-title">2018</div>

						In late 2016 and early 2017, we built a pre-primary classroom for 25 kids at risk of social exclusion. We also develop social workshops with the community and start a youth sports camp.
					<br>
						Además, abrimos una segunda aula y construimos un espacio público que sirvió para proyectar películas, ofrecer comidas, proveer de juegos de mesa y libros a los habitantes de la zona y, en definitiva, crear comunidad en un barrio en expansión.
						Besides, we opened a second class and we built a public space where movies were played, meals were held, and board games and books were promoted, and ultimately create a sense of community in a growing neighborhood.

						From 2016 to 2019, we collaborated with the Tanzanian NGO Progress for Africa with a common project called ‘Chagua Maisha’ which means ‘choose life’ in Swahili. In this collaboration, we developed several development cooperation projects, aiming to contribute to the improvement of the beneficiaries in Born City, a growing neighborhood with limited access to basic needs.

			<p>
				Collaborating with us is really simple. You can do it in different ways, such as, contributing with a punctual donation, granting us a space, volunteering with us, etc. Moreover, Maisha Roots believes that the <strong>social fabric</strong> of a community is the key to growth and, therefore, we also look for <strong>links and alliances</strong> with enterprises, entities, and other NGOs. We expect these collaborations to be more than economic support and we try to establish collaborations that promote the development in Tanzania.

			<h3>Needs assessment for a future project</h3>
			<p>
				Maisha Roots believes that the success of every project resides on a good identification of the population’s needs.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Therefore, after the acquired experience and the lessons learned from our first project “Chagua Maisha”, we have decided to start a  <strong>research process</strong> that defines <strong>defines the most demanded and needed projects</strong> in Arusha’s neighborhoods.
			</p>
			<p>
				This needs assessment is being carried out jointly by the Tanzanian team and our Projects Technician, based on the project cycle methodology:

			<h4>Continuing training in development cooperation</h4>
			<p>
				Development cooperation includes a very technical part for which adequate professional training is needed. Therefore, and always considering the great experience of the Tanzanian counterpart in the sector, we believe in continuous training which takes place simultaneously to the needs assessment. The main aim of this training is that the Tanzanian counterpart can continue developing their knowledge on the projects’ identification and development cooperation.

			<h3>Partner organizations</h3>
			<p>
				Maisha Roots looks for organizations that aim to collaborate in the development of Tanzanian societies. We try to establish long-duration relations that go further than economic donations, based on a win-win strategy for both organizations. It can be through corporative volunteering, pro bono services, or economic donation. We also look for ethical corporations, that accomplish with our <a href="./img/docs/Criterios_de_selección_de_colaboradores_y_contrapartes-Maisha_Roots.pdf" class="link" target="_blank">partnership selection mechanisms</a>.
				<br>
				We have collaborated with enterprises such as GAJO, an ethical trademark of clothes with developed corporate social responsibility. We also keep a solid partnership with Proyecto Amanecer, a Spanish NGO which collaborate in the execution of development projects. Punctually, other organizations have collaborated in some of our actions, such as two theatre companies (La Locandiera Teatro y Katharsis Teatro), Palencia’s Diputación de Deportes, Mbuyu Association and an Arts exhibition ‘50x50x50’,

			<h3>Good governance Mechanisms</h3>
			<p>
				Maisha Roots advocates for transparency and good governance, accomplishing with the stipulated regulations, both intern and extern, in all the actions that we undertake.
			</p>
			<p>
				Maisha Roots identifies, as good governance principles, these:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="./img/docs/Mecanísmo_de_gestión_de_conflictos_de_interés-Maisha_Roots.pdf" class="link"  target="_blank">Management of conflicts of interest in the Management team</a></li>
				<li><a href="./img/docs/Criterios_de_selección_de_colaboradores_y_contrapartes-Maisha_Roots.pdf" class="link"  target="_blank">Responsible selection of partners and collaboration</a></li>
				<li><a href="./img/docs/Aprobación_de_gastos_y_selección_de_proveedores-Maisha_Roots.pdf" class="link"  target="_blank">Reasoned approval of expenses and suppliers</a></li>
				<li><a href="./img/docs/Control_de_donaciones-Maisha_Roots.pdf" class="link"  target="_blank">Donations control</a></li>
				<li>Compliance with regulations in force on data protection</li>
				<li>Complaints channel</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Therefore, we have created some documents as a regulatory body for the performance of any action taken within the organization which applies to:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Members of the General Assembly</li>
				<li>Management team</li>
				<li>Employees</li>
				<li>Volunteers</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				All these members assume the accomplishment of these principles automatically, in their date of commencement within the organization. 
			</p>
		
			<h4>Complaints channel</h4>
			<p>
				With the aim of accomplishing our commitment with transparency and good governance, Maisha Roots makes available to the employed and volunteering staff, donors, suppliers, partners, etc. a complaints channel that allows us to identify irregular behavior within the organization. This irregular behavior includes any illegal action, irregular or against law- both intern and extern- undertaken by the organization Maisha Roots or any of its members.

				In this link you might find the related document to our complaints channel: <a href="./img/docs/Canal_de_denuncias-Maisha_Roots.pdf" class="link" target="_blank">Complaints channel.</a>
